### Implementation notes

I've decided to use an HTTP REST API for the Checkout Service over other implementation approaches such as a GraphQL 
based API since having high levels of flexibility for querying this system doesn't seem to be a key requirement given 
the use-cases of the Checkout Service.

### Requirements

- docker
- docker-compose
